Most functions and sequences are based on CAN tutorial by Fabian Greif
(http://www.kreatives-chaos.com) and his CAN library. I took the freedom
to adapt and re-write, so I could learn and not only take it as is. You
may have still the feeling, that I did not understand some things fully.
You could be right ;-)
Nevertheless, without Fabians work, this little project would have taken
much, much longer or may never even finished.

Thanks!
